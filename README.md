### meet in the midl - take two 

An exploration into React Native. A work in progress. 

My final project at Makers was a web app called meet in the midl which allowed the user to select the location of themself and a friend and then calculated the middle point between them based on journey time rather than geographical. The app would then make recommendations as to places to meet in the middle area and also give a link to directions by different modes of transport. 

A problem we had with the web app is that the google maps API key was absolutely rinsed due to using autcomplete, nearby places and multiple markers. I don't have unlimited access to funds for the API usage, so I will have to come up with a simpler way of accessing and using a map in the app. 

The web app has users, the data controlled by a Rails backend API, I will not be introducing the users feature to the phone app as it didnt bring that much extra to the user experience.
